# pve-qemu-kvm

Proxmox does not support anything other than `x86`/`x86_x64` even though `qemu` which is in it's backend supports to emulate MANY other CPU architectures.

Furthermore there is currently only support for `alsa` driver while `qemu` has advanced support for jack and pulseaudio.

Since I felt this is a disservice to `proxmox` and `qemu` as great technologies, I've decided to start fixing it.

This `Dockerfile` and `make` script will build your own version of `pve-qemu` and remove the `--target-list` configure options enabling all supported CPUs and emulations for the proxmox `pve-qemu` DEB package.

Since this is done with docker you need not worry about any other dependancies other than docker to build the DEB packages you need.

## Dependancies
- Docker

## Build DEB Packages
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lillypad/pve-qemu-unlocked.git
cd pve-qemu-unlocked/
make
```

__NOTE:__ If you do not specify `-j#` in the `Dockerfile` the build will take up more than 32GB of RAM. If you want faster builds and you have more RAM, you can modify this to your specific needs.

`DEB` files will be stored in `bin/`

## Installation

There will be a debug as well as a regular build.

You will want to use `dpkg` to install the non-debug version on proxmox unless you are debugging or developing.
